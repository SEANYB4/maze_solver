# maze_solver

This is a project I completed as part of the boot.dev curriculum.

To run it, wou will need to have a version of Python installed.
Clone the repository into a directory on your computer and run 'python main.py'
You should see a randomly generated maze drawn onto the screen, and then be able to watch as the program algorithmically solves the maze.
